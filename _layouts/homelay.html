We are an inter-disciplinary team of researchers working in visual computing, in particular, computer graphics and computer vision. Current areas of focus include 3D and robotic vision, 3D printing and content creation, animation, AR/VR, generative AI, geometric and image-based modelling, language and 3D, machine learning, natural phenomenon, and shape analysis. Our research works frequently appear in top venues such as SIGGRAPH, CVPR, and ICCV (we rank <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?vision&graph&world">&%35;14 in the world in terms of top publications in visual computing</a>, as of 6/2023) and we collaborate widely with the industry and academia (e.g., Adobe Research, Amazon, Autodesk, Google, MSRA, Princeton, Stanford, Tel Aviv, and Washington). Our faculty and students have won numerous honours and awards, including <a href="https://rsc-src.ca/en/fellows">FRSC</a>, <a href="https://s2022.siggraph.org/program/awards/#:~:text=Outstanding%20Doctoral%20Dissertation%20Award%0AXuebin%20(Jason)%20Peng">SIGGRAPH Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award</a>, <a href="http://graphicsinterface.org/awards/alain-fournier/#:~:text=2015-,Ibraheem%20Alhashim,-2014">Alain Fournier Best Thesis Award</a>, CS&#124;InfoGAN Researcher Award, Google Faculty Award, <a href="https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/?category=2021#:~:text=of%20California%2C%20Merced-,Zhiqin%20Chen,-%2C%20Simon%20Fraser%20University">Google PhD Fellowship</a>, <a href="https://www.borealisai.com/news/borealis-ai-2020-2021-fellowships-supporting-canadas-ai-research-ecosystem/#:~:text=Borealis%20AI%202021%20Fellow%3A%C2%A0Nelson%20Nauata">Borealis AI Fellowship</a>, TR35@Singapore, CHCCS Achievement and Early Career Researcher Awards, <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/Grants-Subs/DGAS-SGSA_eng.asp">NSERC Discovery Accelerator Awards</a>, and several best paper awards from CVPR, ECCV, SCA, SGP, etc. Gruvi alumni went on to take up faculty positions in Canada, the US, and Asia, while others now work at companies including Amazon, Apple, EA, Facebook (Meta), Google, IBM, and Microsoft.
